# Welcome to the Full Stack Decal

Hey there and welcome to the Full Stack Decal course content! We've seperated out our course into a couple sections:

### Lessons
These are small tidbits of information that are normally taught lecture-style in our DeCal. 

### Homework
Homework is used to practice various skills learned in Lessons to get hand-on-practice developing with web technologies. 

### Projects
To bring all your skills together, projects are larger development tasks that encompass multiple lessons' worth of content.
