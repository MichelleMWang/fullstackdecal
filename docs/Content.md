# Introduction to the Full Stack Development

### Brought to you by Web Development at Berkeley

Introduction to Full Stack Development is a 3-unit Decal taught by students passionate about web development at UC Berkeley. This course began as the internal education program for it's parent club, Web Development at Berkeley, and since then it has been developed and refined and is now offered to the entire Berkeley student body. 

This course contains **a lot** of content. Covering the entire web development stack is no easy task. The technologies that underwrite web development are numerous, diverse, and often esoteric. Each serves a specific purpose, and is designed to surve that purpose *exceptionally* well. That does not make learning it any easier. It does, however, make learning it that much more worthwhile. Understanding each of the technologies we will cover is a small investment in understanding a vast, complex, and necessary system, and we hope that with what you learn, you will be able to contribute as much as you learn with us.

In this reader, you will find several types of content. All of this content, except for guides, will be covered in the Decal. 

### Lessons
These are the course readings, and cover the information that we normally teach lecture-style in our DeCal. 

### Homework
Homework is used to practice various skills learned in Lessons to get hand-on-practice developing with the technologies we teach in this course. 

### Labs
This is a new component that we are piloting this semester. Labs give a hands-on, guided approach to learning the skills we teach in lecture.

### Projects
To bring all your skills together, projects are larger development tasks that encompass multiple lessons' worth of content.
