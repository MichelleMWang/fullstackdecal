# Welcome to the Full Stack Development Decal

Hey there and welcome to the Full Stack Development Decal's course content! We've seperated out our course into a couple sections:

### Lessons
These are the course readings, and cover the information that we normally teach lecture-style in our DeCal. 

### Homework
Homework is used to practice various skills learned in Lessons to get hand-on-practice developing with the technologies we teach in this course. 

### Projects
To bring all your skills together, projects are larger development tasks that encompass multiple lessons' worth of content.
