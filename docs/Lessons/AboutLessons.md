# About Lessons

We've broken up this course into 22 lessons, organized by a natural progression from front-to-backend, with an extra unit for UI/UX design. In the progression of this course, we hope to give you some intuition about how a varities of technologies come together to form the modern Internet experience. From an efficient backend to an intuitive frontend to an attractive UI, the modern website is carefully curated and pushed forward by newer and newer technologies which enable us to provide the user with most utility and best possible experience. In this course, we hope to gain a sense of these technologies, and perhaps more importantly, we hope that you find that spark that inspires you to understand and utilize these technologies for yourself.
