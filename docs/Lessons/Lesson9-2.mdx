# Lesson 8.5 - React 1: Example

In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with
React.

You can see what we’ll be building here:
[Final Result](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010). If the code
doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax,
don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its
syntax.

We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the
tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered
list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of
the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game
progresses.

You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. We’ll be
starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you
up so that you can start building the game.

## Setup

Let's start by cloning the starter code for our project.

Please clone
[the lecture content Github repo](https://github.com/fullstack-decal/sp22-lectures)
onto your machine if you haven't already. The code for this example can be found
under the `react-example-1` directory. If you navigate into the
`react-example-1` folder, you should see a `starter` and `solution` folder. If
you ever get stuck, feel free to look at the `solution` folder, but for now
let's get started by opening up and working in the `starter` folder.

See the React 3 starter code in the starter code repo. By inspecting the code,
you’ll notice that we have three React components:

- `Square`
- `Board`
- `Game`

**Let's start simple! Say, we want to display a number in each of the squares,
in this way:**

What we are going to do to make this work is "pass a prop" from Board to Square.

### Props

Props are a vital part of the React fabric! We can think of props as a
dictionary that each React Component maintains to look out some values
associated with it. If we don't give the attribute any props, then this
dictionary is empty. However, if we were to pass some props in, say, in this
way:

```jsx
function Board {
  renderSquare(i) {
    return <Square value={i} />;
  }
	...
}
```

Now, the React component `square` has a prop called `value` with some...well,
value associated with it.

A very important note: **PROPS ARE IMMUTABLE**. Once some prop has been assigned
to a component, it can never be changed, only accessed.

So, how do we access this prop? Like so,

```jsx
function Square(props) {
  return <button className="square">{props.value}</button>;
}
```

Quick explanation - the Square function is being given an argument (`props`) and
one of those props is called `value` and we want whatever is associated with
that variable name to be displayed as the text of a button.

Congratulations! You’ve just “passed a prop” from a parent Board component to a
child Square component. Passing props is how information flows in React apps,
from parents to children.

### Making It Interactive

What if we want our button to _do_ something? Well, we have our classic JS way
of doing that in such a way:

```jsx
function Square {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick="alert('click')">
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
}
```

We used to put our `onClick` JS in a string because we were writing in HTML, and
I never liked embedding code like this, it feels very unclean. But there are no
more such restrictions! So, let's change this to suit the fact that we're
writing in JS now.

```jsx
<button className="square" onClick={function() { alert('click'); }}>
```

Or, even better

```jsx
<button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
```

Let's try to log the value for the square out using the onClick function:

```jsx
function Square(props) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => console.log(props.value)}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Now, if you click on one of the square, it will log out its value!

## Development, Continued

### State

Now, what if we want to change whichever box we click to stop displaying the
number and start displaying an X? We've run into a problem, because we can't
change what `this.props.value` is (remember: props are immutable!). Could we
just do something like:

```jsx
this.storeValue = this.props.value;
<button className="square" onClick={() => somehowUpdateStoreValue()}>
  {this.storeValue}
</button>;
```

And yes, yes we could –– but we won't be able to see the change unless we
re-render our component, in which case we lose `storeValue`. So we're stuck. How
to resolve this issue?

This is where we can start to use **State.** Props and state go hand-in-hand ––
while props are the values you ask your parent component to give you and
utilize, state is the value that you as a component want to maintain –– and
change as necessary.

For this, we will introduce state to the Square React component.

```jsx
function Square(props) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {this.props.value}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Now, to introduce state.

```jsx
function Square(props) {
	const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value);

	return (
      <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
        {value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

Great! Now, we have a value "null" with which we do nothing. Let's change that,
shall we?

```jsx
function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value);

  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => setValue('X')}>
      {value}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Notice a few changes: we're using `value` instead of `props.value` and our
`onClick` function uses `setValue`.

The `setValue` function does two things –– it changes that value in the state
that you pass in, and it rerenders the component while persisting the state and
props.

### Lifting State Up

The last important topic of today!

Currently, each Square component maintains the game’s state. To check for a
winner, we’ll maintain the value of each of the 9 squares in one location. Could
we make Board should just ask each Square for the Square’s state? Sure! But we
discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to
bugs, and hard to refactor. Why? Because information flows downward in React,
from parent to child component. To make information flow upwards is considered
bad practise and is discouraged whenever possible!

So how do we get information to Board without making Square tell Board its
state? **Let Board remember the state of the Square.** Then we make the _Board_
tell the _Square_ what the square to display –– and we already know how to do
this (shh its through props!)

This practise is called "lifting state up" and is common when React components
are refactored.

Add a constructor to the Board and set the Board’s initial state to contain an
array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:

```jsx
function Board(props) {

	const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
	...
}
```

This 3x3 Array is our game board! Right now, it displays an unplayed empty
board. How do we make sure the square displays what it should? We change our
`renderSquare` function.

```jsx
const renderSquare = (i) => {
  return <Square value={squares[i]} />;
};
```

Each Square will now receive a value prop that will either be 'X', 'O', or null
for empty squares.

There is still one problem–– when a square is clicked, we somehow need to inform
`Board` of that. But we don't want to take the button out of `Square`. We need
to create a way for the Square to update the Board’s state. Since _state is
considered to be private to a component_ that defines it, we cannot update the
Board’s state directly from Square. What do we do?

The answer is wonderfully simple –– pass in the a `handleClick` function defined
_in_ BOARD!

```jsx
const renderSquare = (i) => {
  return <Square value={squares[i]} onClick={() => handleClick(i)} />;
};
```

And now, we make sure the Square class reflects these changes:

```jsx
function Square(props) {
  render() {
    return (
      <button
        className="square"
        onClick={() => props.onClick()}>

        {props.value}

      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

And now, finally, let's define `handleClick`

```jsx
const handleClick = (i) => {
  const squares_copy = squares.slice();
  squares_copy[i] = 'X';
  setSquares(squares_copy);
};
```

Why do it like this? Because of `React` best practises! React suggests that we
treat our state as immutable as well, even if it is very much mutable. This is
to prevent the user from changing state and not causing a re-render when they do
so (because they didn't do it right). Thus, to change `squares`, we make a copy
of it, edit that copy, then set our state `squares` variable to that copy.

### Conditional Rendering

We now need to fix an obvious defect in our tic-tac-toe game: the “O”s cannot be
marked on the board.

We'll store this in our Board State!

```jsx
function Board(props) {
	const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
	const [xIsPlaying, setXIsPlaying] = useState(true);
	...
}
```

Everytime a click happens, we want to change the player. Thus, we change
`handleClick`

```jsx
const handleClick = (i) => {
  const squares_copy = squares.slice();
  squares_copy[i] = xIsPlaying ? 'X' : 'O';
  setSquares(squares_copy);
  setXIsPlaying(!xIsPlaying);
};
```

And because we can, let's edit render to display who the player is at any given
moment:

```jsx
const status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsPlaying ? 'X' : 'O');
```

### Helper Functions For Logic

How do we define who the winner is? We could figure out some clever way of doing
it inside the component, but here's another piece of React wisdom –– React is a
UI Library. We should let React handle the UI part, and the logic part should
stay outside, for the most part. In this vein, here's a helper function:

```jsx
const calculateWinner = (squares) => {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5], // ["o", "x", "o"]
    [6, 7, 8], // ["x", "o", "x"]
    [0, 3, 6], // ["x", "x", "x"]
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ];
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a]; // "x"
    }
  }
  return null;
};
```

Now, we want to update status depending on who the winner is. Let's update the
render, then!

```jsx
const winner = calculateWinner(squares);
let status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsPlaying ? 'X' : 'O');
if (winner) {
  status = 'Winner is ' + winner;
}
```

And finally, we want to make sure that once the game is done, clicking the baord
doesn't do anything. So, we change `handleClick` which is conviniently located
inside of Board itself:

```jsx
handleClick(i) {
    const squares = squares.slice();
    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {
      return;
    }
	...
 }
```

And we're done!!

### Final Code Result

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';

function Square(props) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => props.onClick()}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  );

  // Board() => renderSquare(0) => <Sqaure value={0} />
  // Square:
  //     stateValue = 0
  //     onClick => setStateValue("X") => stateValue = "X"
}

function Board() {
  const calculateWinner = (squares) => {
    const lines = [
      [0, 1, 2],
      [3, 4, 5], // ["o", "x", "o"]
      [6, 7, 8], // ["x", "o", "x"]
      [0, 3, 6], // ["x", "x", "x"]
      [1, 4, 7],
      [2, 5, 8],
      [0, 4, 8],
      [2, 4, 6],
    ];
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
      const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
      if (
        squares[a] &&
        squares[a] === squares[b] &&
        squares[a] === squares[c]
      ) {
        return squares[a]; // "x"
      }
    }
    return null;
  };

  const [squaresState, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
  const [xIsPlaying, setXIsPlaying] = useState(true);
  // [null, null, null,
  //  null, null, null,
  //  null, null, null]
  const winner = calculateWinner(squaresState); // "X"

  let status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsPlaying ? 'X' : 'O');

  if (winner) {
    status = 'Winner is ' + winner;
  }

  // Board() => renderSquare(0) 0: array index (represents the state of one of the square)
  // squares =
  // [null, null, null,
  //  null, null, null,
  //  null, null, null]
  // onClick => props.onClick => handleClick(0)
  // squares =
  // ["X", null, null,
  //  null, null, null,
  //  null, null, null]
  // renderSqaure(0) => <Sqaure value={squares[0] (this would now be "X")}

  const handleClick = (i) => {
    const squares_copy = squaresState.slice();
    if (calculateWinner(squaresState) || squaresState[i]) {
      return;
    }
    squares_copy[i] = xIsPlaying ? 'X' : 'O';
    setXIsPlaying(!xIsPlaying);
    // if (xIsPlaying) {
    //   squares_copy[i] = "X"
    // } else {
    //   squares_copy[i] = "O"
    // }
    setSquares(squares_copy);
  };

  const renderSquare = (i) => {
    return <Square value={squaresState[i]} onClick={() => handleClick(i)} />;
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="status">{status}</div>
      <div className="board-row">
        {renderSquare(0)}
        {renderSquare(1)}
        {renderSquare(2)}
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        {renderSquare(3)}
        {renderSquare(4)}
        {renderSquare(5)}
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        {renderSquare(6)}
        {renderSquare(7)}
        {renderSquare(8)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Game() {
  return (
    <div className="game">
      <div className="game-board">
        <Board />
      </div>
      <div className="game-info">
        <div>{/* status */}</div>
        <ol>{/* TODO */}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// ========================================
