# HW 1 - HTML


## Introduction:

In this homework we want students to learn how to create an HTML webpage using all the widely used common HTML tags. Images of the expected look of the page will be provided for their reference. The aim will be to create an information page for a popular celebrity of the student’s choice. We have divided the webpage into multiple segments and will walk through the different segments as the webpage builds.

## **Learning Objectives:**

- Using essential HTML (text) tags
    - h1, h2, p, b, i, sub, sup, br, etc.
    - Creating bulleted lists using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags
- Embedding an image in the webpage using `<img>`. Alternate text prop
- Linking to different pages -  1 live page and 1 local page (`<a>` tag).
- A button to perform a basic task like an alert.
- Creating a basic form on the local page.
- Basic info about meta tags

## Setup

Go over this template to have a tentative structure to start your homework.

Although this is your first homework, if you bear with us, we’ll try our best to guide you through it. Today, you’ll be creating a webpage about famous Stranger Things actor Steve Harrington. This website includes an image, a table of contents, headings, paragraphs, and so much more!

Please follow the exact content given in the following instructions above and try to copy the above image exactly so that the autograder can give you full points.

## Q1- Title, Heading

First, we will need a title to tell our readers what they will be reading about

Set the title of the webpage as “Steve Harrington Tribute”.

After the title, set the heading as “Steve Harrington”. This should be a size 1 heading (**hint:** h1).

Notice how the heading and title are different

## Q2 - Wikipedia Page Hyperlinking and Intro

Now, let's add a link that navigates the user to elsewhere on the web! Use the **`<a>`** tag to add a link to the actual wiki page from your wiki page. Here's the link to the actual wiki page. Look up the **`<a>`** tag to see how you can make the new page open up in a new tab.

Now we will write a paragraph about Steve Harrington as shown in the image above.

## Q3 - Celebrity Image

## Q4 - Table of Contents and Info

Let's make a table of contents, like the Wikipedia page, except that we will not include links just yet. Instead, our table of contents will be simply text for now. Use `ul` and `li` tags to create a table of contents.

Set the size of ‘Content’ as h3.

Now we are going to write some real stuff and go deeper in the content.

Set the main heading to `<h2>` and write the rest of the information on seasons using a combination of the `<h3>` and `<p>` tags.

## Q5 - Alert Button

Let's add a button to this page! When clicked, the button should pop up an alert message that thanks the user for being a big Steve Harrington fan! Here’s a quick breakdown of the alert function.

The alert message should say - “Thank you for being a big Steve Harrington fan!”.

## Q6 - Local Page and Form

In your folder, let's create another HTML page! We'll call this page secret.html. Use the skeleton code given above for this page too. Now, we want to create a link in our main index.html that navigates to the secret.html page. 

We’ll add a form to this local page. Before that add a link with the name ‘Click here for a secret!’ that leads to this secret page in a new tab. 

Now that we have a secret page, we can do ~ secret stuff ~. That is to say, we're going to ask for the user's name and email on the secret page. Using the `form` and `input` tags, create a form that accepts a name and email, with a submit button.

Your form should look something like this:

You might need to use some **`<br>`** tags to make the form look like this.

### Metadata

The `<meta>` tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

Tags like `title` and `meta` go into the `<head></head>` of your HTML document. These tags are responsible for telling search engines and the browser top-level information about your site.

A common structure is `<meta name="____", description="____"/>`

### Conclusion

This concludes your fanpage. You are now a Steve Harrington superfan! Even if not a Stranger Things fan, we hope you are now an HTML fan. Remember, HTML is the outline of the Internet. In this homework, we learned how to layout and template content. While it looks ugly right now, we will see in the next homework how to add some snazzy style and even more functionality!
