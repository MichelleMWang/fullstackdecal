# HTML

## Introduction

If you are creating anything that is for the web, you need to understand how basic HTML tags format text, embed images, and create links.

Before the web, we used ink on paper. Now, **HTML is the ink and the browser is the paper.** The browser converts HTML into something formatted to make it easier to read.

## Goals
In this homework, we'll slowly add various HTML elements to a webpage to build it up into a creating a wikipedia page for your favorite TV show character. It will have a survey at the end that can be filled out. You don't have to do yours about Steve Harrington (although we will appreciate it if you do).

Are you ready? Good — let's begin!

## Setup

Clone the starter code for this HW.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fullstack-decal/sp22-assignment1-starter.git
```
To see your HTML code in a browser, right-click on the index.html file and select Open With: Chrome (or your default browser)

::: Before you start

Make sure to watch the lecture and read the HTML [lesson notes](https://fullstackdecal.com/docs/Lessons/Lesson2) before starting this assignment.

## Requirements

### Add Texts of Different Sizes

Add some text to your HTML page with tags including `h1`, `h2`, and `p`. You don't need to limit yourself to these — use whatever tags you'd like!

### A List of Table of Contents

Let's make a table of contents, like the wikipedia page, except that we will not include links just yet. Instead, our table of contents will be simply text for now. Use `ul` and `li` tags to create a table of contents.

### Add an Image
  
Let's break through the monotony with some fun images! Use the `img` tag to add an image to your wiki page. Here's an [image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/img-0127-jpeg-1509475357.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.889xh;0,0&resize=480:*) to use, for convinience! 
  
### A Link That Navigates Away
  
Now, let's add a link that navigates the user to elsewhere on the web! Use the `a` tag to add an link to the actual wiki page from your wiki page. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harrington) the link to the actual wiki page.
  
### Add A Button

Let's add a button to this page! When clicked, the button should pop up an `alert` message that thanks the user for being a big Steve Harrington fan! [Here's](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) a quick breakdown on the `alert` function.

### Linking to Another Page

In your folder, let's create another HTML page! We'll call this page secret.html. Use the skeleton code given above for this page too, and add a simple secret message. Now, we want to create a link in our main index.html that navigates to the secret.html page.

### Add A Form To The Secret Page

Now that we have a secret page, we can do ~ secret stuff ~. That is to say, we're going to ask for the user's name and email on the secret page. Using the `form` and `input` tags, create a form that accepts a name and email, with a submit button.

### More Meta Tags

Final job: Let's add `meta` tags to `index.html`. There should already be 3 meta tags in `index.html`. Consult [this list](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp) to add one more. The page shouldn't look any different, but your metadata should be much better!

**That's the end of the requirements! Feel free to play around and make the website as detailed as you want. Have fun!**
