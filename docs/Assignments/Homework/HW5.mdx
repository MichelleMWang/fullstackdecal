# HW 5 - Node.js & MongoDB

## Introduction

In this homework, we will utilize the NASA APOD API. The Astronomy Picture of the Day, or APOD, API is a popular NASA
API that refreshes daily to give users a new picture of the day from NASA's vast archive. Because we love this pictures so much,
we will create an API that extends the functionality of this API, allowing a user to search for lists of dates, or get a list
of return objects.

To be clear, we are building an API that interfaces with another API. This is a common design pattern, and is a necessary part
of many of the more complicated web applications to integrate with other services.

We will be using the APOD API to retrieve the pictures that we are going to store.
Before we start this assignment, please go to the APOD section and familiarize yourself with the endpoints and accepted parameters.
We will need these later as we write our own API to interface with the NASA API.
