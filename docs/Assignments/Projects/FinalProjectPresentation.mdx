# Final Project

## ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

Well, you made it to the final project, **congratulations!**

We know that it's been a long journey to get here and that there have been many
hardships and trials that you've had to endure on your journey as a student of
web development, but we are confident that you'll be able to create amazing
final projects to be proud of.

The final project is meant to be as open-ended as possible while still having
just enough requirements to ensure that you're able to use everything you've
learned to the fullest capacity and learn along the way. Think of the final
project as something you'd want to build at a hackathon, but spread out over 3-4
weeks. Let your imagination fly, let the wings of your mind soar, and let your
creativity sprout to be able to build whatever your heart desires. After all,
that's why we do what we do here with your web development skills - **we wish to
build**. 

Our goal for the decal was to give you all the power to **build whatever you
could think of** - and now is the time to try doing so. Failure at first is
unfortunately essentially inevitable, but we hope that throughout the journey
you will be able to grow as both a developer and as a student. 

## ðŸ“¦ Logistics

You will be placed in a team of ~5 people with **1 month** to brainstorm, 
create, and deliver a full stack project! Your project must include a 
**design** component, a **frontend** component, and a **backend** component.
Every team will also be assigned mentors that will help guide you throughout 
this project and assist you with any questions that you or your team may have.
This project is split into **3 phases** and is due on **April 28th**. You will
submit on Gradescope and connect with your mentor after you are done with each phase. 
On April 28th, every team will demo their project to their classmates and a panel of 
exciting people. After the project is over, every team member will submit a peer evaluation form. 

### Phase 1

Phase 1 is due on **April 7th**. This is the **brainstorm** phase. Your team will
decide which members will be doing design, frontend, or backend. Your team must 
then write some document that defines your **project idea and purpose**, the 
**features** you are planning on implementing, and your **tech stack**.

**Project idea and purpose** should outline your project and why you are motivated
to create it. You should also include which team members will be working on which
element of your project. 

**Features** should outline what you are trying to implement in your project. Do
you have some feature to share with your friends or view data from some API? That
should all be included here. 

**Tech stack** should define which technologies you will be using to complete your
project. The MERN stack is a common example: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and
Node.js. Also include any APIs or extra libraries/frameworks you will be using to 
complete your project.

After you have completed these steps, email or message your mentor and show them 
your work to be done with this phase.

### Phase 2

Phase 2 is due on **April 14th**. This is the **prototype** phase. Your team must
have **design wireframes** complete and a project repository with working **prototypes** 
of any **page components** and **backend files** created.

**Design** members need to complete some mockups of pages or components and showcase
them in Figma or any other design tool.

**Frontend** members need to create some page components that will showcase how 
your project will be divided. For instance, in Tic-Tac-Toe, we had a game component, 
a board component, and a square component. Come up with a component heirarchy
that makes sense and create these classes/components inside of your React project.

**Backend** members need to create files in the project repository that outlines
how they are going to create, update, retrieve, and destory data from their database, 
as well as how their database is going to be organized. What information are you storing?
Where are you storing it?

We will have a full stack lab on April 19th to help integrate your project's frontend
with your backend. So don't worry about how those two will connect until then. Just communicate
with each other on how the frontend side and backend side should sync up before then.

### Phase 3

Phase 3 is due on **April 28th**. This is the **final** phase. Your team will complete both 
the **frontend** and the **backend** and integrate them together. Your challenge here will 
be to finish your entire project before the project deadline. Be sure to communicate with your 
group members to split up tasks and work efficiently, and use your project mentors and/or course 
staff to help you if you are stuck. 

## ðŸŒ  Demo Night

On **April 28th** we will have a project showcase/demo night! Every group will have ~7 minutes to
present their project to their classmates and a panel of course staff/WDB members and other exciting
people.
