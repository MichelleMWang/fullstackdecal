# Final Project Presentation

## ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

Welcome to the final project presentation! You make it to the last day! This is
the time you got to demonstrate your hard work for the past three weeks!

### ðŸ“¦ Logistics

Each group will have 8 mins to **present & demo** their project. Hereâ€™s a list
of topics that you can cover in your presentation. You donâ€™t need to follow it,
and this is meant to just be a guide.

- What motivates this project?
- What are the tech stacks?
- Which features have you implemented?
- Any changes from the project proposal night?
- What difficulties have you encountered?
- Any next steps?

### ðŸŒ  Demo

1. Each group is **required** to demo their project.
2. It is ok to demo the project on a local computer via a local host.
3. You have to walk through the features you have implemented
4. At the end, briefly talk about any technical difficulty you have encountered
