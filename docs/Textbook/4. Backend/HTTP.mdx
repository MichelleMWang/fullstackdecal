# HTTP

### Learning Objectives

## What is the Internet?

When we think of the Internet, we often think only of the websites which we are
visiting. What we don't see is the vast numer of resources that it takes to request and receive that website.

Modern web applications consist of two major parts: a frontend and a backend. I
like to use the restaurant analogy to visualize the difference. A traditional
restaurant consists of two main parts: a dining room and a kitchen. When we
order, we only ever see the nicely-furnished, well-decorated dining room. But
when we order, we only give our order to the waiter. The waiter relays that order to the kitchen.
A complicated set of instructions is then executed to produce our order and the
waiter, like magic, returns with our food.

Similarly, when we use a website, we interact only with the frontend. The
frontend is content that the user can interact with
directly. However, when we interact with that frontend, the frontend is responsible for
interacting with a backend that produces the content that we want. Practically, the frontend requests
content from the backend, and renders that content for the user.

The natural question, then, is how do the frontend and backend communicate? The
answer is HTTP. HTTP is the backbone of the Internet. The Internet is, largely, just a
constant exchange HTTP requests being sent back and forth across a vast
network. It is the language of the network.

HTTP(S) comes in two main flavors, the _request_ and the _response_. Being full-stack engineers,
we must understand both how to send requests and how to send responses. For a full-stack application, the frontend sends requests,
while the backend sends responses.

## HTTP Requests

An HTTP requests consist of two parts: the _header_ and the _body_.

Imagine we are sending a letter to a friend. The body of the request is like the letter itself, it contains the content
that we are interested in relaying.
The header is like the envelope. It contains all the pertinent information about where the letter needs to go.
It tells us where, how, and when the content of the request is to be sent, and communicates where the response needs to go.

Below is an example of an HTTP(S) header.

```plaintext
GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: https://developer.mozilla.org/testpage.html
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
If-Modified-Since: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 02:36:04 GMT
If-None-Match: "c561c68d0ba92bbeb8b0fff2a9199f722e3a621a"
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

The first line defines three key components: the method, the request location, and the protocol. 


The remaining lines are used to specify information about the request. This
includes potential authorization, cacheing, handling, etc. At this level, we
won't be using these too much, but as your applications become more complicated,
taking advantage of these headers may allow for significantly more
functionality.

### Methods

Methods define what kind of request we are sending. These are also commonly known as HTTP _verbs_. 
We use HTTP verbs to simplify and organize our requests. When a server receives a request, it uses the method
to determine what information it needs to complete the request, and what information the user is expecting in return.

There are many HTTP verbs, but the most commonly used ones are listed below:

1. **[`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET):**
   The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource.
   Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.
2. **[`HEAD`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD):**
   The `HEAD` method asks for a response identical to that of a `GET` request,
   but without the response body.
3. **[`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST):**
   The `POST` method is used to submit an entity (a form) to the specified
   resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
4. **[`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT):**
   The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource
   with the request payload. In other words, you can use `PUT` to update a
   resource.
5. **[`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE):**
   The`DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.
6. **[`CONNECT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT):**
   The`CONNECT` method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the
   target resource.
7. **[`OPTIONS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS):**
   The `OPTIONS` method is used to describe the communication options for the
   target resource.
8. **[`TRACE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE):**
   The `TRACE` method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the
   target resource.
9. **[`PATCH`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH):**
   The `PATCH` method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

You **do not need to know all of these**. The most relevant ones to us, and for most use cases, are `GET`,
`POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

In future lessons, we will go into more detail about where, when, and how to use these methods,
but for now, just know that when we make a request, we should have a good idea of what kind of request it is,
and what information we need to provide to complete the request, as well as what content we should expect in return.

### HTTP Responses

Just as we make requests to a server for information, we also expect a response.
Even if we do not expect data in return, the server always sends a response
indiciating that it received the request. 

Responses are essentially our "return" value.
They act as our only way to understand what the server is doing. There are two main cases with responses:
- If the server is performing correctly, then we receive as a response carrying the content that we requested
- If the server errors or we did not request content, we expect our response to be a success message or an error message indicating what went wrong. 

Below is an example of response codes.

- `1XX`: Informational
- `2XX`: Successful
- `3XX`: Redirection
- `4XX`: Client Error
- `5XX`: Server Error

Response codes are categories of response types. Depending on what type of response or what type of error it is,
the response code will be different, helping us trace exactly what is wrong with our request.

Here are some of the most common response codes.

- `200`: OK. Meaning that the request of a specific resource (list of TODOs) are
  successful.
- `201`: Created. Meaning that a resource is created / updated successfully.
- `401`: Unauthorized. Meaning that the request is unauthorized, the client
  needs to be logged in.
- `403`: Forbidden. Meaning that the resource is not available for the client.
- `404`: Not found. Meaning that the resource accessing is not served.
- `418`: I'm a teapot. Meaning that the server refuses the attempt to brew
  coffee with a teapot.
- `500`: Server error.

Again, you do not need to know every response code, but you shoudl familiarize yourself with what they mean, broadly, 
and understand when you make a request, what response codes you expect and what response error codes you might get. 

# Anatomy of a Request

When we make HTTP requests, we use a particular organization to ensure that the
receiving server can process our request. Note: This example focuses on requests
without a body.

Let's look at the following request

```bash
GET 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto'
```

Now let's look at the components of our request.

`https://` defines the protocol we are using. In this case, we are using the
HTTP secure protocol

`[pokeapi.co/](http://pokeapi.com/)` defines the server (computer) to which we
are making our request. When we make a request, we are essentially making it to
a particular IP address. In the case of domain names, your Internet service
provider does some cool stuff (which I won't go into here) which essentially
aliases this domain name to an IP address to complete your request.

`/api/v2/` We will learn later about the importance of this. For now, think of
it like this: In order to make our request, we have to request a certain part of
the website where the content we want is kept. For example, navigate to the WDB
website [webatberkeley.org](http://webatberkeley.org). As you click on the
different options in the menu, notice that the URL in the search bar is
changing. To get the information you want, you need to go to the location where
it is stored. Our requests follow a similar (In fact, directly related) pattern.
We must make our request in the right place to get what we want. In this case,
we are making a request to the API, specifically v2 of the API. You can also
think of it as a large file system, where to access the files we want, we
navigate to their location at the server (again directly related to how websites
function).

`/pokemon/ditto` It may not be immediately clear why these are the search terms,
or why they differ from `/api/v2` in terms of functionality, but bear with me.
Ultimately, all of these `/` 's represent how the designers of the website have
chosen to organize the website. When we make a request to an API, we must make
the request directly to the API, or else the website will likely return HTML
files to be rendered. That is why this particular website used `/api/v2`.
**_Every website will be different._** It is up to the designer how they
organize their website, and as the client, it is your responsibility to check
the docs for how you can get what you need. After we access the API, we are
telling the website: "Please look at Pokemon, and of those, please look at
Ditto." The last term is usually a unique key which maps to a single entry of
data which is what _you_ want.

## Fancier requests

URL encoding is a fairly straightforward part of web development so we won't
dive too deeply into this, it is more of something you learn as you go, and a
lot of the packages that we use handle these kinds of things for you. If you
were curious, we can in fact add more information to our get request.

Instead of just telling the web server _where_ to get the data, we can, in some
cases specify the type of data that we want to get. Where as the previous
request returned exactly the data item that we need, think of this as more like
a search. We can give the website some query parameters to return the data we
want. This is done with the `/?key1=value1&key2=value2` syntax. The `?`
specifies that we are encoding query parameters, and the `&` key allows for
encoding of multiple parameters.

The following API returns a random number when called.

```bash
https://csrng.net/csrng/csrng.php
```

Let us try calling it with no parameters.

```bash
curl 'https://csrng.net/csrng/csrng.php'
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
[
	{
		"status":"success",
		"min":0,
		"max":9007199254740991,
		"random":1462051404510535
	}
]
```

Now let's try calling it with some encoded parameters. Type in the following to
your terminal.

```bash
curl 'https://csrng.net/csrng/csrng.php?min=1&max=100'
```

You should now see something like this:

```bash
[
	{
		"status":"success",
		"min":1,
		"max":100,
		"random":44
	}
]
```

Notice that now, the API is only returning random numbers between the parameters
that we specified! In fact, we can clearly see that the API received our
parameters and set the min and max accordingly. This becomes important in
applications like search and efficient design (querying instead of constantly
subdividing resources). For example, type something into Google and look at the
URL! What might this tell you? Think on it.

# JSON

Look at our last example. You may be wondering, why does the response look like
that? When we make requests to an API, if we get a status `200` code we can
expect that the server will return some data. What kind of data it returns
depends on what kind of data we are seeking. In some cases, it might return
entire HTML pages, that is what your browser will render into a "website". In
other cases, we simply want a snippet of data from our server, not an entire
page. In order to the server to return this kind of data in a standardized and
easily accessible way, we use JSON to send the data. JavaScript Object Notation
is an open standard file format and data interchange format. While it does say
JavaScript in the name, think of JSON as _completely language agnostic._ It is
fair to say that JSON is one of the backbones of the Internet. Much of the data
that is exchanged between servers and clients is sent in JSON. Here is an
example of JSON:

```jsx
	{
		"status":"success",
		"min":1,
		"max":100,
		"random":[44, 20, 30],
		"extra": {
			"hello": "goodbye",
			"goodday": "goodnight"
		}
	}
```

**NOTE: I've added the "extra" field to demonstrate that JSON can nest JSON,
this would not have been in your response from the previous example.**

JSON is much like a dictionary in Python or a Map in Java. Contained within the
object are several keys which map to values. These values can be strings
(wrapped in quotes), numbers, lists, or even more objects.

JSON is critical to understanding how we exchange data. It not only defines how
we receive data from the server (`GET` for example), but it also defines how we
send data to the server (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

You do not need to worry about what all these fields mean, just notice the way
that necessary information is organized and easily accessible. Status Code:
`200`, url, method: `GET` , and data, are all incredibly important pieces of
information, and JSON makes them significantly easier to access in a
standardized way.
