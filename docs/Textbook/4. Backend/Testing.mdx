# Postman

Postman is an incredibly helpful tool for testing and validating our APIs. In
this case, REST APIs. Postman is essentially a systematic and user-friendly way
to send predefined requests.

Let's open Postman together.

Once you create an account and login, you will be met with a picture of your
workspace. Click on Workspaces > My Workspace. There should be nothing there
except maybe an example request that we could make. We will now be returning to
our previous examples to show how we can make systematic GET requests to the
same APIs.

[Example API](https://www.notion.so/6550d800e50149b1ab4d789485dc1969)

Additionally, `/db/all` supports a query param specifying the maximum number of
items to return.

I will teach you how to run this program fully, but for the purpose of this
exercise,

# EXTRA: RESTful Server in Action and Postman

To understand REST API and HTTP methods a step further, let us take a look at a
RESTful server in action.

Let's say we are building a TODO app. Take a look at the following code. Pay
close attention to what the comments address.

```jsx
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

var port = process.env.PORT || 8080;

var router = express.Router();

const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// The method of the root url. Be friendly and welcome our user :)
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.json({ message: 'Welcome to the TODO app.' });
});

// All HTTP methods under the /todos URL.
router
  .route('/todos')
  // This GET method is in charge of returnning all the todos.
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Return all todos.' });
  })
  // This POST methods is used to create a new todo.
  // Its request will have a body, containing the content of the new todo.
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.json({
      message: 'Create a new todo: ' + '1' + ' - ' + req.body.content,
      todo_id: '1',
      content: req.body.content,
    });
  });

// All HTTP methods under the /todos/:todo_id URL.
// The /:todo_id is a parameter within the URL that specifies a particular todo.
router
  .route('/todos/:todo_id')
  // This GET method is used to get the content from a specific todo.
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Get the content from a todo.' });
  })
  // We use PUT method to update a todo's content.
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.json({
      message:
        'Update the todo: ' + req.params.todo_id + ' - ' + req.body.content,
      todo_id: req.params.todo_id,
      content: req.body.content,
    });
  })
  // DELETE method is used to delete a todo.
  .delete((req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Delete a todo.' });
  });

app.use('/api', router); // API Root url at: http://localhost:8080/api

app.listen(port);
console.log('Server listenning on port ' + port);
```

Now with the dummy server ready, how should we send all the HTTP requests?
Introduce a new tool in our workflow —— postman.

Let's start the server with `npm run start` and see how can we interact with the
server.

## Postman

Postman is a platform for API development. It can easily build and send out API
requests.

Once you download and install postman, click `new collection` on the left side
bar to create a new collection of API requests. Let's call it
`RESTful server test requests`.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3abb55f3-73b2-457a-bc9c-c86bb238e1e1/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3abb55f3-73b2-457a-bc9c-c86bb238e1e1/Untitled.png)

Then, click on the more button and add a request. Let's first test out the API
for the root URL:

```jsx
// The method of the root url. Be friendly and welcome our user :)
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.json({ message: 'Welcome to the TODO app.' });
});
```

Create a request and make sure its HTTP method is GET. Our root API url is at
[`http://localhost:8080/api`](http://localhost:8080/api). After you click send,
you should be seeing a JSON response body, which consists of a message with the
content of "Welcome to the TODO app."

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/03941e2c-a074-48b4-a526-2a4a2f18be38/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/03941e2c-a074-48b4-a526-2a4a2f18be38/Untitled.png)

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1aa74a60-3351-49d6-b23a-0a3aa071b8dc/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1aa74a60-3351-49d6-b23a-0a3aa071b8dc/Untitled.png)

## Create API requests using POSTMAN

Postman is a very powerful tool as it can save your API request and resend it
again and again at your will. Let's save this and create mroe API requests to
test the `GET` request that fetch all todos and `POST` that create a new todo.

```jsx
// All HTTP methods under the /todos URL.
router
  .route('/todos')
  // This GET method is in charge of returnning all the todos.
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Return all todos.' });
  })
  // This POST methods is used to create a new todo.
  // Its request will have a body, containing the content of the new todo.
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.json({
      message: 'Create a new todo: ' + '1' + ' - ' + req.body.content,
      todo_id: '1',
      content: req.body.content,
    });
  });
```

Let's first create a new request, and use
[`http://localhost:8080/api/todos`](http://localhost:8080/api/todos) as the
request URL. We start by testing out the `GET` request, and after clicking send,
you should see the following JSON as a response:

```jsx
{
    "message": "Return all todos."
}
```

Now let's try out the `POST` request, unlike the `GET` request, the `POST`
request contains a **request body**. If the post request does not contain any
body, you would receive something like this:

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a6b67769-4da2-43e5-b3b4-4a08409f9c63/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a6b67769-4da2-43e5-b3b4-4a08409f9c63/Untitled.png)

This `undefined` in the message means that the server does not receive the
content of the todo, which should be included in the request body.

To add a request body, click on **Body** and then select `raw`. Change the
format from `TEXT` to `JSON`, and you are ready to write your first request
body.

Let's say I want to create a todo with content "hello world todo". Then, we
create a JSON like this:

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bf032666-e48f-4e58-9d44-2958a234cc8b/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bf032666-e48f-4e58-9d44-2958a234cc8b/Untitled.png)

You should be receiving the message with the content you just created in the
body.
