# APIs

### Learning Objectives

## Application Programming interface

An Application Programming Interface, more commonly known as an _API_, is a set of rules that define how users interact with
software. APIs are not only found in web development. Instead, they are found up and down the EECS stack. For us, the user, 
the vast majority of software is a black box. Instead of trying to understand every line of code for software that we use, 
we often rely on the developer to define methods that we can use to interact with that software. If we only need to learn 
those methods, we should be able to utilize the full functionality of the software without ever having to peek inside.

In web development, an API is used to define what methods a server has. For example, let us say our website has endpoints that
where users can GET data, endpoints where users can POST data, and endpoints that do both. As the developer, we need to
make clear to the user which endpoints accept data, which endpoints send responses with data, and what kind of data is send
and received. The user will need all of this knowledge in order to work with our server. 
To keep track of all of our needs, we use REST to create APIs that are robust, well-organized, and most importantly,
_language-agnostic_.

If an API is language-agnostic, that means that APIs written in any language can interact with our API. For example, if we 
write our API in JavaScript, an API written in Python, or Swift, or Kotlin, can access our API just as easily as one written
in JavaScript. This is form of standardization in the industry, and is an incredibly powerful tool. With proper utilization
of API, there is no limit to the reach of your data, and much of the power of the Internet comes from the fact that it is 
accessible to all. 

## REST API

REST API is an acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. REST APIs are specific to web development.
REST defines a loose set of rules and general style for how web APIs should be constructed and how data is handled.

Here are the six guiding principles of REST from
[https://restfulapi.net/](https://restfulapi.net/):

1. **Client-server** – By separating the user interface concerns from the data
   storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across
   multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server
   components.
2. **Stateless** – Each request from client to server must contain all of the
   information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of
   any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on
   the client.
3. **Cacheable** – Cache constraints require that the data within a response to
   a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable.
   If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse
   that response data for later, equivalent requests.
4. **Uniform interface** – By applying the software engineering principle of
   generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is
   simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain
   a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide
   the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints:
   identification of resources; manipulation of resources through
   representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of
   application state.
5. **Layered system** – The layered system style allows an architecture to be
   composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that
   each component cannot “see” beyond the immediate layer with which they are
   interacting.
6. **Code on demand (optional)** – REST allows client functionality to be
   extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.
   This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be
   pre-implemented.

A server application that implements a REST API is also called a **RESTful** server.

RESTful APIs are the industry standard. They offer an extremely powerful and extensible model of development that 
can be scaled from small projects to complex web frameworks and apps. In the upcoming chapters, we will learn how to
build and deploy our own RESTful APIs.
