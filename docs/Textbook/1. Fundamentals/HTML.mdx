# HTML

### Learning Objectives

## The Frame

## Tags

HTML is a declaritive language. 
As a declarative language, HTML lacks common computer science paradigms like control flow and functions.
Essentially, that means that you define _exactly_ what the HTML will do.

You can think of HTML as an outline. You outline the sections that you want on your website, and then you fill them with the content you want. 
HTML renders our document exactly how we lay it out, and to lay it out, we use _tags_.

Tags are the building blocks of HTML.
A tag serves two main purposes:

1. It labels a section, giving the programmer an easy way to refer to that section and the content inside.
2. It gives the content in that section certain features, allowing certain types of interactions on specific types of content.

A section is labeled by an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag has the tag name with the `<` on the left and the `>`
on the right. The closing tag is similar, but has `</` on the left and `>` on the right. 

Each type of tag defines specific features for the content inside.
For example, plain text is wrapped in a `<p></p>` tag while links are wrapped in an `<a></a>` tag, making them clickable.

## Nesting

The power of HTML comes from the fact that you can nest tags. Sections of your document can contain subsections
which can contains even more subsections and so on. HTML can be nested arbitrarily, which means there is no technical
limit to your nesting. There is, however, a pracitcal one, as we will discover, but hold tight for that.

## The Basics

The simplest possible HTML document is the empty document. The empty document still contains four sections which 
define the barest bones of any HTML document. Let us look at it below.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
```

First we use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define this as an HTML document for the browser. We then declare all of our HTML
with the `<html></html>` tag. Inside our document, we have two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`. 

The `<head>` is what we use to hold the _metadata_ of the website. Metadata is the part
of the website that you never see. The browser automatically knows not to render the `<head>`. 
We use the `<head>` to contain all the important information about the website: the title, the author,
and links to the other components of the website, namely the CSS and JS files that we use to style and functionalize
the website. 

The `<body>` of the website is where all of the content goes. The `<body>` is rendered by the browser, and our CSS and JS
modifies the content in the body to style and functionalize our website. 

## More Tags

HTML defines a variety of tags that are used for a special purpose.
