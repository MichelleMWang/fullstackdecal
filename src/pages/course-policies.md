## Office Hours
We hope you take advantage of the office hours we have scheduled this term, and we will support both in-person and remote office hours. When coming to office hours for lab or project help, there are some policies you'll need to abide by.

Please do not expect TAs to debug your code. This is not a good use of their time, and part of the goal of this course is to turn you into a great tester and debugger. However, the TAs can help you find and fix your bugs.

## Discussion Forum
All important course announcements will be made on Piazza and Slack.

## Piazza Etiquette
- Search before posting. Your question may have already been answered by us or other students in the past. Reading other students' posts will let you refine your question, and gives us more time to answer new questions.
- Link and screenshot any external resources you are referring to (exams, discussion, StackOverflow, lecture slides + webcast time/video). It is more convenient for us and other students to look at the screenshot and follow the link if we need more context on the question. It will also substantially decrease the time it takes for us to answer your question.
- Try to avoid open-ended or vague questions such as: "How does C work?" or "How come the solution to a discussion problem is this?". If you walk us through your thoughts and reference specific lines that you find confusing, we can better address the problem you are facing. Being specific helps us uncover any misunderstandings that you may have.
- Post questions about assignments as public follow-ups on the corresponding assignment post. For example, post your questions about Homework 1 on the Homework 1 post. If your question is too detailed or revealing to fit as a follow-up, your question would be better answered during office hours.
- Only post in the "Student Answer" box if you are fairly certain about your answer. Do not post follow-up questions or +1 in the student answer. Posting in the "Student Answer" section marks a post as resolved and will likely be missed. Use follow-ups to follow-up while leaving the overall post unresolved.
- No follow-up +1's. Instead, you should use the Helpful! button on a question/follow-up. We do not allow +1's because they clutter the post and make it more difficult to get to the unresolved follow-ups.
- If you want a reply on a follow-up, mark it as unresolved, or we may not see it.
- If you reply to a follow-up answering the question at hand, mark the follow-up as resolved, since it no longer requires attention.

## Grading
All Decal's are taken pass-no-pass, this one is no exception. Your final grade will be based primarily upon your attendance and completion of Homework and the 3 projects. A "pass" is a 60% in the class

### Grading Breakdown

| Item | Percent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Attendance   |    50%    |
| Homework     | 15%  |
| Project 1     | 10%  |
| Project 2     | 10%  |
| Final Project     | 15%  |


## Deadlines
Any assignment which is due by the end of the day is due by 11:59:59PM Pacific Time.

## Homework
Homework is designed to let you practice the week's material. We encourage you to work on the homework problems in small groups, but each student is required to turn in a solution that they have written themselves.

Homework is graded on completion.

Every day homework is late, your grade will decrease by 10%.

## Projects
Projects are designed to give you heavy-duty experience with the application of course content. Projects are graded on correctness. You must work on your own for each project with the exception of the fial 

## Accommodations and Extensions
Some forms:

- Extension Requests: This is to request extensions on deadlines for any assignments. Requests will be reviewed approximately every two business days. Note that approved lab extensions are rounded up to a week so you can attend your assigned section. Extensions will not be visible on Gradescope and PrairieLearn, but they will show up on grading reports.
- Extenuating Circumstances: This form is for any circumstances that can't be resolved with extensions or lab section changes. Don't be afraid to reach out! We're here to help you succeed in our course.
Extenuating Circumstances and Inclusion

We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and have widely-varying experiences. If you encounter extenuating circumstances, please do not hesitate to let us know. The sooner we are made aware, the more options we have available to us to help.

## Inclusion
If something is said in class (by anyone) that makes you feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by a staff member or fellow student, please report the incident to our instructors, head TA, or another member of staff you're comfortable with so that we may address the issue to create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. You may also contact the department's Faculty Equity Advisors (CS) Prof. Josh Hug hug@cs.berkeley.edu or (EE) Prof. Robert Pilawa-Podgurski pilawa@berkeley.edu, the Campus Ombuds Office or the ASUC Student Advocate's Office (SAO). You may also use the department's Student Climate and Incident Reporting Form.
