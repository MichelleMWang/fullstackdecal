Thank you for applying to the Full-Stack DeCal! Decisions have been sent out so,
make sure to check your email! If you were offered a spot in the DeCal and chose
to accept, please attend our first class on Thursday, February 3rd, 6:30pm -
8pm, in the Physics 1 classroom. If you're not enrolled but would still like to
come to the class, feel free to do so!

**To those who weren't offered a spot in the DeCal:**

Hopefully this explanation of why we limit of our class size can provide some
context into why we have to be a selective course this semester.

We don't want to limit enrollment (which is why we've doubled class size since
last semester, and are planning to ideally double it again next semester). The
biggest constant we have on people we take is the size of our course staff,
because grading homework takes a LOT of time especially for web dev which isn't
easy to create autograders for. We also commonly get feedback about the DeCal
being pretty difficult, so we want to make sure we can hold a proportional
number of Office Hours so instead of serving 200 students poorly we can properly
support and teach 100 students. Nobody wants 10-hour long OH queues, especially
for a DeCal.

To counter this issue we make ALL materials public on our course website
(schedule, readings, homework, lectures) so it's as easy to follow along as
possible. The course website is fullstackdecal.com. I know it isn't a substitute
for the pressure and community for a class, but we hope this at least makes
learning the material simpler and more straightforward/structured. We've had
people go through our curriculum by themselves and have told us that they
learned a lot, so hopefully self-learning the material can help!
