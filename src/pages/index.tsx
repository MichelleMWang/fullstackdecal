          &apos;s Introduction to Full Stack Development! In this course, we
          cover the basics of web development, how the internet works, and the
          frameworks, technologies, and best practices that are used in the
          industry today. No prior CS experience is required to participate and
          succeed in this course, but we do acknowledge that we cover a fairly
          large amount of material and that this course can feel like a lot,
          even for those with past CS experience.
